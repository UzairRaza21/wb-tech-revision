    <h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

    <h4>HOW CAN A CLIENT REQUEST A REFUND?</h4>
    <p>If the client is dissatisfied with the quality of work even after a maximum of three revisions, they may request a refund of the amount paid to WB SoftTech. To initiate a refund request, the client must provide a detailed explanation via email from their registered email address to contact@wbsofttech.net.</p>

    <p>WB SoftTech will conduct a comprehensive audit of the entire case history to determine the client’s eligibility for a refund.</p>
    <p>Refunds typically require up to 21 business days to be processed. For further details regarding our refund policy, please check the terms and conditions below. Refunds will be issued back to the client’s credit card if the refund request is made within 180 days from the payment date and if the original credit/debit card is active. After 180 days from the initial payment date, refunds will be sent to the client via alternate methods such as PayPal, Zelle, etc.</p>

    <h4>MONEY BACK GUARANTEE</h4>
    <p>We have immense confidence in our skills and design quality, which is why we provide a money-back guarantee in case we fall short of expectations. This guarantee is offered in good faith, with the expectation of mutual respect from our customers. While the majority of our customers are honest and cooperative, some may attempt to exploit this flexibility by seeking refunds after receiving design concepts from multiple providers simultaneously. Such practices are unfair and unethical, and undermine the value of human expertise. If you engage in such behavior, we prefer not to conduct business with you.</p>
    <p>Design work is inherently subjective. Without quality feedback from customers, achieving the perfect design on the first attempt is unlikely. WB SoftTech is a custom design company that highly values customer involvement in the design process. Typically, initial design samples serve as a starting point for discussion rather than the final product. Through customer feedback, we gain insights into preferences and refine designs accordingly. The Money Back Guarantee ensures customers are covered if we fail to meet their expectations.</p>
    <p>The Money Back Guarantee applies specifically to design packages. Once you approve a design and request further revisions, the Money Back Guarantee no longer applies. However, you still benefit from our 100% satisfaction guarantee, ensuring we continue to refine your design until you’re fully satisfied.</p>
    <p>The Money Back Guarantee does not extend to services such as content writing, SEO services, marketing support services, domain and hosting services. Additionally, it does not apply to design agencies, design studios, or individuals working on client projects.</p>
    <p>Please be aware that customers requesting refunds will forfeit the right to use the initial design concepts provided. Copyrights for all designs remain the property of WB SoftTech until full payment is received.</p>
    <h4>CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY:</h4>
    <p>The refund policy of WB SoftTech LLC will be void if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You have selected a customized service package.</li>
        <li>The primary design concept has received approval.</li>
        <li>Revision requests have been submitted.</li>
        <li>Cancellation has occurred for reasons unrelated to the company.</li>
        <li>The company has not been contacted for over two weeks regarding the project or if the client stays ghosted for more than two weeks.</li>
        <li>Violation of company policies has occurred.</li>
        <li>Another company or designer has been approached for the same project.</li>
        <li>The creative brief lacks necessary information.</li>
        <li>A complete overhaul of the design has been requested.</li>
        <li>The refund request exceeds the designated timeframe.</li>
        <li>Business closure or name change has been initiated.</li>
        <li>Refunds will not be granted for reasons such as “change of mind” or “disagreement with partner,” or other non-service-related issues.</li>
        <li>For clients subscribing to service bundles, refunds will only apply to the specific service in question, not the entire bundle.</li>
        <li>Refunds will not be issued after seven days from the date of purchase.</li>
        <li>Certain services, including Social Media, SEO, Domain Registration, and Web Hosting, are non-refundable.</li>
        <li>Once the client approves the design and the website proceeds to development, refunds for website services will not be accommodated.</li>
        <li>Refunds are not applicable once the contract has been sent to the client, signed, and returned within 48 hours unless valid reasons are provided.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>NOTE</h4>
    <p>WB SoftTech reserves the right to decline any project or terminate the contract as deemed necessary. Following a refund, you forfeit any rights to utilize the designs for any purpose; they become the exclusive property of WB SoftTech, with the company assuming full ownership.</p>
    <p>Cancellation of an order is permissible within seven days of purchase, subject to specific eligibility criteria, as the company has already incurred expenses and allocated resources toward order processing and fulfillment. Eligible reasons expressly exclude instances such as a change of mind, disagreements with partners, discovering cheaper alternatives, or any similar reasons unrelated to service levels. If cancellation occurs within the initial 24 hours, a cancellation charge of 15% of the invoice amount will be retained, while cancellation after this period will result in a 25% retention of the invoice amount. Cancellation requests must be submitted via email to info@wbsofttech.net.</p>

    <p>All correspondence between the WB SoftTech team and the client must be documented using a registered email address provided by the client. For order deliveries, the company will make at least three attempts to contact the customer via the email address provided by the customer. If there is no response after three email attempts, including delivery notifications and reminders, and seven consecutive working days have elapsed since project delivery, the project will be considered accepted by the customer. In such cases, the company will not entertain any refund requests, as it has already allocated resources for project fulfillment and allowed reasonable time for the customer’s response. Additionally, if the customer remains unresponsive to their registered email address with the company for 10 consecutive days, the money-back guarantee offer for the contract/project will be rendered void. WB SoftTech retains the discretion to review and enforce this offer.</p>
    <p>Any prices or packages advertised on this website are exclusive of any applicable taxes. Payments made via Visa, MasterCard, and Amex cards are processed through our bank’s merchant services. WB SoftTech does not retain customer card details on its systems to ensure maximum security and PCI compliance. For recurring billing, card details are stored with merchant services for future transactions. Additionally, we accept payments via personal/company checks and bank transfers. Payments made through PayPal and Discover Card are processed by PayPal.</p>
